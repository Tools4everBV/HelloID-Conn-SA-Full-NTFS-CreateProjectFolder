# Create Project Folder

This form creates a new NTFS folder (e.g., a project folder) for storing and sharing files. 

## Business Benefits

This form can create a new NTFS folder without direct access to the file system. By controlling access, security is improved. Additionally, this form can be assigned directly to users, thus reducing the Servicedesk's ticket load.
